# RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) System

## Overview

This project implements a robust Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system with user authentication and authorization. It provides a secure framework for managing user access to resources based on their assigned roles.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure registration, login, and logout functionality.
- **Role-Based Authorization**: Implements role-based access control with predefined roles (Admin, User, Moderator).
- **Secure Session Management**: Utilizes JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for managing user sessions securely.
- **Resource Access Control**: Restricts access to specific resources or endpoints based on user roles.

## Technologies Used

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework for building the frontend and API routes
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) - ORM for database management
- [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/) - Authentication library for Next.js
- [JSON Web Tokens (JWT)](https://jwt.io/) - For secure user session management
